What to spend time on is something I spend a lot of time on thinking. (Notice the irony?)
So the way I see what to spend time on a macro-scale for myself boils down to what problems I want solve. And over time with tons of discussions, debates, arguments - I managed to create a strongly opinionated - weakly held framework for myself. This is solely my opinion and how I see problems and a lot of it might seem to be from the feels of a problem rather than objective metrics. In my defense, I am still iterating over the thought process and am improving on representing my weights for metrics better.

Over the course of problems I have tried my hands on in life, I have realised that the projects that give me most pleasure or reward are `high impact`. `high impact` is a super subjective term. So, to explain my meaure of `high impact` better - I use the following questions to start with
1. Would Flipkart be high impact if it wasnt there today? Yes
2. Is AI for Cancer Diagnosis high impact ? Definitely.
3. Is Appdynamics high impact if it wasnt there today? No
4. Is building a game that reaches 1bn downloads high impact? No
5. Is building IOT for farmers high Impact? Yes
6. Is an app that gives automated feedback while working out high impact? No
7. Is building UPI or Phone Pe high impact? Yes

The above answers gives a loosely bound idea of my definition of `high impact` but I think for the lack of a better vocabulary or writing skills - I call it `first order impact`. There is tons of second and third order impacts of SAAS tools like Appdynamics or mass scale games but somehow that has failed to excite me enough. (yet - Never say Never)
Another obsrvation from above if you make is that problems/projects that change the regular lives of tons of people automatically become high impact for me. This makes me biased towards India specific problems which automatically weigh higher in my head.

Next metric is `ROI`. Since, I weigh `impact` so high for evaluating problems, I also understand `impact` isnt just a peak in the time series graph but an area under the curve. So, If its high `ROI` - be it monetary, networking or upskill - I will weight it higher. Monetary, Networking and Skill returns upgrades your choice of problems in the future automatically and opens a whole new league of possible problems. Having tons of money allows Bill Gates to work towards eradicating malaria - I really cant think of anything more impactful being done by a human today. Having the right networking or having worked with the right set of people allows you to form a consortium of complimentary skillsets to solve more complex problems. And of course, having upskilled in any domain allows you to tackle harder problems in the domain. 

And counter-intuitive to most people, least important but non-zero importance is `Difficulty`. Who doesn't like challenges and rewards of solving a really hard technical problem. The adrenaline rush and the applause and respect in the though niche domain of the problem is definitely enticing and appealing. 

## TLDR 
I decide what to spend time on at macro-level on the basis of the following metrics with which I weigh the problem in order of importance.
- First Order Impact
- ROI
  - Monetary
  - Networking
  - Skill
- Difficulty
