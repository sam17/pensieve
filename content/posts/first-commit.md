To be blogger since '94. 

^That has been my status/description/go-to line to justify  my procrastination and insecurity sound cool. But at some point, this had to change. <<Insert cool taking the leap quote>>


So, what do I plan to write on? Anything that I think about, work on, matters to me, changes me or even I find it cool. Like this entire idea of starting to write and its manifestation in my head followed by reality.

I have been planning to write  but I procrastinated giving myself reasons (read life-lies). I even build this entire framework of thoughts like having a website first, figuring out a design, have a set of content and launch - as if I am am booker prize winner and my blog will get a million hits on first minute. As I deep dived into  my life lies and its source originating from laziness, insecurity and expectations from self bundled together -> I decided to break-down the problem. 

**Step 1**  
Laziness. I decided to write and never tell. That worked because it removed all the insecurity along with the user-experience lies in my head since I would just sit down and write for just myself.

**Step 2**  
Insecurity and Expectations. Post writing, I needed feedback on same starting with a small set of people. So I found some guinea-pigs aka friends whom I forced through the shit I had written, that too without editing and taking feedback. Did I do anything about the feedback? Absolutely not! 


**Step 3**  
All-in. And here we are. I have my first writing up which is about my struggle with writing itself. Meta much?


_How often do I plan to write?_  
My `JAS OKRs`(What is that? That's for another article. :D) say one blog per two weeks and we are on 4th week with this first article, so 5 more to go by September. Can I make it?
