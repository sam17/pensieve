To be blogger since '94. 

^That has been my status/description/go-to line to make my procrastination and insecurities sound cool across all possible platforms. But at some point, this had to change and I took the leap. <<Insert cool leap quote>>


So, what do I plan to write on? Anything that I think about, work on, matters to me, changes me or even I find it cool. Like this entire idea of starting to write and its manifestations in my head followed by reality.

I have been wanting/planning to start writing but I always procrastinated it giving myself reasons (read life-lies). I even build this entire framework of thoughts slowing down like having a website first, figuring out a design, have a set of content and launch - as if I am Arundhati Roy and my blog will get a million hits on first minute. As I figured my life lies and its source which includes some amount of laziness, insecurities and expectations from self bundled together, I decided to break-down the problem. 

Step 1. 
Lets fix laziness first and I decided to write and never tell. That worked because it removed all the insecurity issues along with all the user-experience lies in my head since I would just sit down and write. 

Step 2.
Now after spending couple of months writing on multiple things, I needed to start getting feedback on same so I found some guinea-pigs aka friends whom I forced through the shit I had written, that too without editing. :D

Step 3.
Time to go all-in. Thats this. And here we are. I have my first writing up which is about my struggle with writing itself. Meta much?
