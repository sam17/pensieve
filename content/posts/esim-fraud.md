eSIM technology supposedly the future of SIM technology with devices can work without hardware SIM. But in this world of OTP where everything needs and OTP and anything can be done with an OTP, does this open up more fraud or reduce? Here is a story.

An innocent non techie guy gets a call from a number saying your phone number is not Aadhar verified and will get disconnected so in order to do that you need to get a new SIM and in this case an eSim. 
How do we get an Airtel eSIM? 
Congrats! You are now just 3 steps away from activating your eSIM. 
Yes its 3 steps where you send an sms with an email ID to 121 and then say yes on a call and then you get a QR code in that email. Not bad, really user friendly. Back to the story.
The innocent guy does the steps above with the email ID given by the person on the call and that sends an application to Airtel to activate eSIM which is activated when a QR code is scanned by a eSIm enabled device and voila, now that guy has access to this number and owns it.
All OTPs come to this number so if that guy has access to any cart details or bank details which isnt that hard to fraud either, then he can transfer/spend the money in the accounts.

The entire point of eSIM is the ability to add security through the device to reduce SIM clone frauds but what the fucking joke of the technology is this cool ass "user centric" setup which has no security in-built at all. I literally need 2 mins with an unlocked phone to steal that persons phone number now. Post this, I will reset their gmail password coz OTP then get their account details from it because bank statements open using a freaking bday even in 2020 and then I own their money, their phone and their email - Thats half (if not full) their identity. 

Coming to what I hate the most post knowing this is that courtesy telecom industry and regulations and the telecom bands, There is no way (how much ever money or tech I throw), I can have a phone number that is not managed or handled by these incompetent nincompoops working in a forever stagnant innovation less telecom industry of the world.
