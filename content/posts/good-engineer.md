A 10x engineer was a trending term for a long time in the technology industry. It became popular to hire first and then it was criticised and then it disappeared like most things on social medial but among all dsicussions, personal experience and opinions thrown, I managed to have a model in my head. My model is inspired from one of the million discussions with couple of my closest friends which revolves around the three qualities (In no particular order):
- Smarts - I define smarts as street smarts or high on lateral thinking i.e. the ability to think out of the box (as most people say) or easily put is the ability to think of non-linear solutions to problems.
- Skill - Skill is simple to define i.e. depth of understanding in the domain that we are talking about. Eg. If its a software engineer, depth of understanding of all the frameworks and fundamentals would be skill.
- Hustle - This is heavily inspired from Mark Cuban and in general Shark Tanks famous term hustle which in my understanding is the perseverance and the desire (tempo in kgp lingo) to keep iterating over a problem till its solved.

Let's try to map this to a problem. 
Problem: India has a vertical bolt to lock doors from inside at the top right corners of doors but sometimes we are unable to close them.

So, most people usually know why the above happens is why I chose the problem but lets say no one did. First response to this problem is to keep pushing the door and attempting to lock the door till it can. #bruteForce
A high skill person will dig into the root cause of the issue and depending on the extent of the skill will understand that its probably moisture or causing the wood to bend or expand inappropriately and will go further (again depending on skill) on how much and why that happens. 
A high smarts would probably figure that this can be solved by just shaving off a few layers of wood and do that.
And lastly, a high hustle person will probably first try shaving off and if it does not work will go deeper into the root cause and keep going till the problem is solved by hook or crook. 

P.S. Above assumes that the human wants to solve the problem. 

Now that the definition of the problem is set aside, do we want all of the above skills in all engineers?  
TLDR; No.
It heavily depends on the role and problem that needs to be solved. Some problems are extremelly deep skilled like if you are hiring for Teslas battery management and some are extremely heavy on smarts i.e. most operations heavy problems. Hustle on the other hand in my head seems to be a secondary or a second order skill i.e. it complements other things but may not individually important (Imagine a person trying the same thing again and again expecting different results #stupid) Despite knowing and understanding this, why I and plenty of entrepreneurs value hustle is that its rare. The need and want to put in the effort beyond ability is really rare and when complimented with other two can change the world (I had to say it at least once). 

What is the relation to 10X engineers?  
10X engineer by definition are engineers who alone managed 10 times the productivity than an average engineer.  
But if an engineer is 10x or not depends heavily on the problem that is being solved. For a heavy software engineering problem like building something like appdynamics, a 10x engineer would be way heavy on skill for software than others. But for something like flipkart, a 10x engineer needs to understand user behavior a lot more so smarts may come in super handy. And if its about an operations heavy role, hustle would be a game changer. Why? Talk to the problems faced by a operations in India. :D

How do I become one?  
Find your space! Understanding your own skill set and directing is probably the most under rated but most useful understanding about oneself. It takes a lot of time but running experiments with what we like and where we stand (percentile) with our metrics of above can tell a lot about the kind of problems you would be valued for and will be good at.  
On a personal note, I see myself decent at skill and hustle but not as much at smarts so I try to look for problems where this skill fits best and I iterate and learn everty time and hope will find a niche for me someday :).

What should someone optimise on?  
I believe everything can be managed if someone wants to solve a problem so I start with what problem do you really want to solve and what does that problem need? If you want to push the boundaries of technology for something, my understanding is optimising on skill is the best way. If you want to ensure a technology reaches the mass, smarts might be your poison to drink more.

P.S. The above is my opinion and understanding today and is open to change. They can be wrong, prepostrous or even maybe amazingly right but thats what they are today.
